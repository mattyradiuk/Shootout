Command Line Soccer Shootout Game
===

## Introduction

**Shootout** is my first attempt at a half decent (yet command line) game using Python. It takes both user input and random number generation to determine the outcome of a penalty shootout at the end of a soccer game. The math currently being used in the RNG process is primitive, but I am planning to do an overhaul on that soon.
