Command Line Soccer Shootout Game
===

## Introduction

**Shootout** is my first attempt at a half decent game using Python 3.7. It takes both user input and random number generation to determine the outcome of a penalty shootout at the end of a soccer game. The math currently being used in the RNG process is primitive, but I am planning to do an overhaul on that soon.  
### Teams and Ratings

I try to keep the playable teams and their respective ratings reasonably current, all of the ratings are my opinion only.

The full lineup of teams is below


1. Real Madrid **84**
2. Barcelona **85**
3. Bayern Munich **83**
4. Juventus **84**
5. Man United **81** 
6. Man City **82**
7. Liverpool **81**
8. Tottenham Hotspur **83**
