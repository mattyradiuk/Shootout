Command Line Soccer Shootout Game
===

## Introduction

**Shootout** is my first attempt at a half decent game using Python 3.7. It takes both user input and random number generation to determine the outcome of a penalty shootout at the end of a soccer game. The math currently being used in the RNG process is primitive, but I am planning to do an overhaul on that soon.  
### Teams and Ratings

I try to keep the playable teams and their respective ratings reasonably current.
The current lineup of teams is below, or create your own using the 'custom' option in-game.


1. Real Madrid 84
2. Barcelona 85
3. Bayern Munich 83
4. Juventus 84
5. Man United 81 
6. Man City 82
